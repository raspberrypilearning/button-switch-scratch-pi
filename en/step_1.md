## Introduction

In this project, you will learn how to wire and control button switches as electronic inputs for a Raspberry Pi 4. You will combine these with simple outputs, such as LEDs, and the latest version of Scratch, to add physical world inputs and outputs to on-screen Scratch games.

This projects follows on from the **[LEDs, buzzers, and Scratch games](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/leds-buzzers-scratch-games){:target="_blank"}** project that looked at physical computing inputs with Scratch 3 and Raspberry Pi.

### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi 4
+ Tactile button switches
+ LEDs
+ 47Ω (Ohm) to 330Ω resistors
+ A buzzer
+ A breadboard
+ Male-to-female jumper leads
