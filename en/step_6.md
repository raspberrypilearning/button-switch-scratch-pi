In the last section, **controlling an LED**, you used a button to turn an LED on and off. Now you are going to use the button to control an LED running a flashing sequence.

You can keep the same hardware setup that you used in **controlling an LED**. If you like, you can easily adapt the project and add extra LEDs or a buzzer.

For your first sequence control project, you'll code the LED to flash only while the button is pressed.
